## What is UTF-8?

UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) is a character encoding scheme that is widely used to represent text in computing systems. It can encode any Unicode character using 1 to 4 bytes.

UTF-8 provides a backward compatibility with ASCII, as ASCII characters are encoded using a single byte in UTF-8. It is also the default encoding for web pages, email, and various text-based file formats.

## How UTF-8 Works

UTF-8 uses a variable-length encoding, where each character is represented by a sequence of 1 to 4 bytes. The number of bytes used depends on the character being encoded.

In UTF-8, the most significant bit of each byte is used as a marker to determine the length of the character. This allows for efficient encoding of commonly used characters while still supporting the entire Unicode character set.

To understand how UTF-8 works in more detail, you can refer to the official Unicode specification or various online resources available.
