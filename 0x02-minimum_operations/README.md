This problem is an example of dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the minimum number of operations required to reach each possible number of H's up to n. We can do this by initializing an array dp with n+1 elements and setting the first element to 0, since it takes 0 operations to get 0 H's. Then, for each subsequent index i in dp, we can find the minimum number of operations to get to i H's by iterating over all possible divisors d of i, and adding the number of operations required to get d H's, plus the number of operations required to copy and paste d H's enough times to get to i H's.
